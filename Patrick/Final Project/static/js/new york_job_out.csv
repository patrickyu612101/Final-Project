Data Scientist,Custoria,"Data science is the core around which Custora is built. The central value proposition of our product is that we provide e-commerce businesses the ability to:

organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with
analyze it for patterns and predictions
deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way
and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door
The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.

Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation˚Ä˚s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn˚Ä˚t even thought of.

On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we˚Ä˚ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we˚Ä˚re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.
Specifically, we are looking for:

A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.

"Senior Data Scientist, Senior Associate",New York Life Insurance Co,"New York Life Insurance Company (˚Ä˚New York Life˚Ä˚ or ˚Ä˚the company˚Ä˚) is the largest mutual life insurance company in the United States*. Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico.
New York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Life˚Ä˚s surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody˚Ä˚s Aaa; Standard & Poor˚Ä˚s AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16).
Financial strength, integrity and humanity˚Ä˚the values upon which New York Life was founded˚Ä˚have guided the company˚Ä˚s decisions and actions for over 170 years.
New York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Lead Data Scientist in its Center for Data Science and Analytics.

We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry. Analytical challenges range from mortality risk (with a number of both medical and non-medical components) to agent recruiting decisions, consumer analytics (segmentation, response, conversion, retention, up-sell), fraud detection and digital advertising placement.

The Center for Data Science and Analytics is the innovative corporate Analytics group within New York Life.

This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products will be implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, new product development).

We work with data ranging from demographics, credit and geo data to detailed medical data (medical test results, diagnosis, prescriptions) and social media information. We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you. Life insurance is on the verge of huge change. This is a chance to be part of, actually to drive, the transformation of an industry. Is this not why we became data scientists?

PURPOSE
The Sub-population Optimization Solutions (SOS) Product Management role is a new strategic position within the Global Consulting Services business focused on developing and commercializing the SOS software and consulting products.

In such scenarios, SOS may help rescue clinical trials that aren˚Ä˚t reaching their primary endpoints or assist in the subsequent trial design.

Partner with Consulting Services Account Leads and Business Development partners to generate and qualify software and consulting leads, meet prospective clients, develop and submit proposals, and close deals
Work with other IQVIA Business Development functions to ensure proper and efficient integration of SOS into clinical trial sales and RFP response processes

"Data & Pipeline Project Leader, Simons Observatory",Simons Foundation,"The Simons Foundation has launched a new computational science organization called the Flatiron Institute. The Flatiron Institute includes three centers ˚Ä˚ the Center for Computational Astrophysics, the Center for Computational Biology and the Center for Quantum Physics.

The Center for Computational Astronomy (CCA), led by David Spergel, aims to become a focal point for computational astronomy around the world and plans to develop the computational tools needed for calculations, simulations and analyses. In steady state, CCA will be comprised of up to 50˚Ä˚60 researchers.

The Simons Observatory is an international collaboration of approximately 200 scientists and engineers who are building a set of telescopes in the Atacama dedicated to measuring temperature and polarization fluctuations in the microwave background. These measurements should provide our best determination of cosmological parameters, probe the growth and evolution of large-scale structure and have the potential to detect gravitational waves emitted during the first moments of the universe˚Ä˚s expansion.

The Data & Pipeline Project Leader will report to the director of CCA, David Spergel, and to the project manager for the Simons Observatory, Andrew Bazarko. At the Flatiron Institute, they will be part of an exciting research environment that will include approximately 55 computational astrophysicists and over 100 computational scientists spread between the Scientific Computing Core and the other computational centers.

"Research Position (Various Levels), Neuroscience",Simons Foundation,"The Neuroscience Group at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Biology (CCB) seeks researchers with various levels of experience. Depending on levels of experience, positions may be at-will Research Scientists; or, term-appointment Flatiron Research Fellows or Associate Research Scientists.


The primary mission of the CCB is to create new computational frameworks that will enable scientists to analyze the large and complex data sets that are being generated by new experimental technologies. Tremendous opportunities for discovery are emerging in the biological and biomedical sciences, as well as in traditional physical and social sciences, but they will require the combined power of theory, data analysis, and simulation. In the biomedical sciences, for example, researchers are being confronted by an explosion of information from genome sequencing, gene expression profiling, proteomics, multi-electrode recording, and multiple high-resolution imaging modalities. The focus remains on problems arising in biophysical modeling, genomics, neuroscience, and structural biology, collaborating closely with experimental colleagues.


The goal of the Neuroscience group is to understand how the brain analyzes large and complex datasets streamed by sensory organs in order to aid efforts at building artificial neural systems and treating mental illness. The group does so by analyzing experimental data, assembling connectomes from high-throughput electron microscopy and determining neuronal dynamics from calcium imaging and multi-electrode recordings.


Researchers will develop algorithms for analyzing high-dimensional datasets of brain activity obtained experimentally, for example, via multi-neuronal calcium imaging. Specifically, work on neural dimensionality reduction (i.e., extracting a low-dimensional neural subspace that captures much of the observed variance) will be required. Researchers will explore methods for inferring synaptic connectivity from large-scale calcium imaging and will develop methods that scale favorably with the number of dimensions and avoid the trap of overfitting. Furthermore, researchers will work in collaboration with experimentalists and theorists on the interpretation of these datasets - in particular, the exploration of whether neuronal computation can be modeled by nonnegative matrix factorization.


This position will be based, and have a principle office or workspace, at the foundation.

Education:
Ph.D in related field

Data Analysis Lead,Motivate International Inc.,"About Motivate
Motivate is North America˚Ä˚s leading bike share firm, operating systems in cities including New York, Chicago, and Washington D.C. Since being acquired in 2014 by a group of investors, including the CEOs of The Related Companies and Equinox, it has successfully undertaken multi-year, major expansions in both New York and Chicago, and launched Nike˚Ä˚s BIKETOWN in Portland. After integrating with 8D Technologies in early 2017, Motivate has also been building its in-house product portfolio, beginning with the Motivate bike. We have been working closely with vendors-themselves some of the leading names in bike share-to co-develop products including new docking mechanisms, eBikes and Smart Bikes.
Led by a group of seasoned urban visionaries, creative leaders and technology innovators, our mission is to revolutionize the landscape of our cities. In an effort to completely transform the urban experience, Motivate is leading the way in making cities more accessible, healthier and sustainable. We create safe and dependable systems that help make cities great by connecting individuals to the people and places they love.

Position Overview
It goes without saying in today˚Ä˚s day and age that data analytics can be transformative for businesses, and nowhere is that more true than in the bike sharing industry. The Business Intelligence group at Motivate is responsible for getting information and insights into the hands of decision makers across all levels of our organization. We are looking to solve problems such as:

- How can we describe our membership in terms of different user segments (commuters, recreational riders, visitors) and create products that appeal to their different characteristics?
- How can we use historic data along with external information to produce more accurate forecasts of future purchasing and riding behavior?
- How can rewards and incentives be used to encourage and discourage behaviors, to help reduce operational cost and system strain?

We collaborate closely with the technology / engineering / product teams, as well as data consumers within the corporate organization in Brooklyn, and across our network of managed bike share systems. The BI team maintains ownership of end-to-end data analysis; we advise on data collection and design experiments, manage our reporting and analytics platform (DBT, Looker, Redshift and Python/R/Excel), define and tr",0 reviews,"Brooklyn, NY",New York
"Data Engineer, In Our Backyards Campaign",Vera Institute of Justice,"The Vera Institute of Justice is working to build national momentum toward reversing mass incarceration everywhere in America. It˚Ä˚s an ambitious goal˚Ä˚so we˚Ä˚re also building a skilled team of researchers who like big ideas and big challenges. Does that sound like you?
If so, read on.
In the last decade, the geography of mass incarceration underwent a quiet, dramatic, shift. As incarceration rates in America˚Ä˚s biggest cities leveled out and then declined, rates in small cities and rural America continued to rise. Today, thousands of often overlooked smaller cities, towns, and rural areas have the highest rates of incarceration and, increasingly, the most outsized jails. This untold story calls for ending mass incarceration where it begins˚Ä˚in all of our backyards.
To spark reform, Vera˚Ä˚s In Our Backyards project is advancing an ambitious research and communications agenda to inform the public dialogue and guide change to justice policy and practice. Our work is driven by the realization that if we do not respond to the shifting geography of incarceration, the apparent national gains˚Ä˚driven by prison and jail population declines in large metropolitan areas˚Ä˚will be eroded by deepening problems in the small and rural communities across the country that actually comprise most of the population.
Responsibilities
The data engineer will work in close collaboration with the team to collect, manage, and analyze data relevant to the criminal justice system, to visualize the results of these analyses, and to report findings to our partners and the public. Data analysis, data management, and software development will be the primary focus.
This position will join an interdisciplinary, cross-functional team that includes data scientists, policy experts, ethnographers, and writers that span the research, policy, and communications functions at Vera.
What we need in you:
Experience assisting with research projects in an academic or professional setting. Our projects involve working with criminal justice system data to answer cutting-edge research questions. Hands-on experience with the research process and intimate familiarity with how to work on a research team are required.
Algorithmic reasoning skills. Many of the problems you will solve require devising a step-by-step procedure from a problem statement to a solution. Experience solving such problems is a must.
Proficiency in at least one programming language. Your duties will include creating or modifying code that retrieves, maintains, analyses, and visualizes data from the criminal justice system. Experience in Python, MATLAB, or R are preferred, but no language-specific experience is required.
Strength in data. Much of the work will involve collecting, cleaning, and maintaining large datasets. Experience working with and managing data are key.
Commitment to the missions of racial justice and ending mass incarceration. You need to be fluent in the language of both, and familiar with their relationship to community/public safety.
YouÅEÄÅEre self-motivated, collaborative and look for how you can help without being told. Collaboration is a Vera value ÅEÄÅE we thrive when we learn and build on each otherÅEÄÅEs ideas, and are open to giving and receiving feedback. WhatÅEÄÅEs more, itÅEÄÅEs absolutely essential for the fast-working In Our Backyards team, which is taking on big challenges, and delving into an area of reform where so much is still unknown.

"Consultancy: Urban Planning, PSN Section, DRP - NYHQ, Requisition #514770",UNICEF,"UNICEF works in some of the world˚Ä˚s toughest places, to reach the world˚Ä˚s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.

Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.

And we never give up.

Background & Rationale

The United Nation˚Ä˚s 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals present a unique opportunity to advance the children˚Ä˚s agenda with a strong emphasize on the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families and in line with UNICEF˚Ä˚s mission. As a defining trend of our times, while urbanization is a driver of development, it is not without its challenges, particularly for slum dwellers. Already, one city dweller in three lives in slum conditions, lacking security of tenure in overcrowded, unhygienic places characterized by unemployment, climate-induced disasters, pollution, violence, poor services and competition over resources. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions, and children and young people are the most susceptible to the negative aspects of living in slums. As the urban population burgeons, it is clear that increasingly urban poor and marginalized children are becoming among the most disadvantaged.

UNICEF has recognized urbanization as an area of evolving importance that poses among the greatest risks and opportunities for children and young people to realize their rights and have a fair chance at life. To help expand these opportunities while also responding to the increasing risks in urban settings, UNICEF has been working to develop policies and guidelines that focus on building sustainable cities for and with children and young people, and in close partnership with government. These tools have started to lay down the ground work for a global urban strategy that will guide and scale up the organization˚Ä˚s work in urban areas at the global, national and local levels.

One of the five pillars of that strategy is ˚Ä˚Adapting urban planning and budgeting for children living in urban settings˚Ä˚, describing UNICEF˚Ä˚s role to advocate for a child perspective in urban spatial planning and development for urban planners, infrastructure developers, and the private sector to make children˚Ä˚s rights and needs a central tenet of their work. The Division of Data, Research and Policy has developed the Handbook on Child Responsive Urban Planning that describes Children˚Ä˚s Rights and Urban Planning Principles and urban planning instruments to ensure child-responsive urban settings. The handbook will support countries to push this agenda through global and regional partnerships, in order to act as a technical advisor or key advocate to implementing partners to promote child-responsive urban spatial planning and infrastructure development.

UNICEF will also use the handbook internally as it lays out relevant elements related with land use, infrastructural norms and standards, participatory urban planning and geo-spatial data, which will support the development of more detailed and improved instruments to support UNICEF˚Ä˚s work for children in urban settings:

Provision of possible indicators to measure progress of the child-responsiveness of urban settings on a local or national level, relevant for the Strategic Plan output indicator 4.d.2, (Number of countries where urban/local government development plans and budgets and urban planning standards are child-responsive and involve participation of children.) and for a new set of indicators for the Child Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI) cycle for developing countries (SitAns, M&E, ˚Äf);
Provision of geo-spatial data management practice to support measurement of intra-urban disparities, relevant for the Strategic Plan output indicator 4.d.1 (Number of countries with data on intra-urban disparities, including girls and boys in informal settings) and to localize most disadvantaged urban populations (expansion of relevant urban data sets MICS, administrative, geo-spatial and big data);
Definition of spatial and land use characteristics of urban settings, relevant to support an urban landscape analysis, urban poverty analysis in urban settings and the definition of needed ˚Ä˚quality social services in urban settings˚Ä˚;
Definition of spatial planning related policies to support UNICEF˚Ä˚s urban programs on a national level and local level (building regulations, urban planning and transportation policy, land use, neighborhood planning, school environments, child-friendly public space networks, public financing of the built environment, geo-spatial data);
Provision of tools to integrate children˚Ä˚s participation in urban planning, in particular adolescents and young people, relevant for the Strategic Plan output indicator 4.d.2 and the CFCI action plans;
Purpose

The purpose of the contract is to provide support to the Urban Planning component within the Urban portfolio of the Policy Analysis Unit. Under the guidance of the Senior Urban Advisor in the Policy Analysis Unit at the Division of Data, Research and Policy in UNICEF, the consultant will support the roll-out the Handbook on Child-responsive Urban Planning outside UNICEF and within the organization, along three pillars: 1. outreach, 2. capacity development and 3. technical assistance. This roll-out has been described in detail in a roll out strategy.

Expected results: (measurable results)

Outreach package containing an on-line softcopy of the handbook, internal and external mailing, presentation material for various audiences, dissemination within UNICEF (global broadcast Message, Yammer, brown bags);

About DPA

The Drug Policy Alliance is the leading organization in the U.S. promoting alternatives to the war on drugs. We envision a just society in which the use and regulation of drugs are grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights; in which people are no longer punished for what they put into their own bodies but only for crimes against others; and in which the fears, prejudices, and punitive prohibitions of today are no more. Our mission is to advance those policies and attitudes that best reduce the harms of both drug misuse and drug prohibition, and to promote the sovereignty of individuals over their minds and bodies.

The Researcher and Quantitative Analyst will join our passionate, diverse, and creative team at a critical time for the drug policy reform movement in the United States. U.S. leaders are now doubling down on the war on drugs, using it as a tool to stoke fear in society and rally their base, and as an excuse to lock up or deport people of color and immigrants. Tens of thousands of people are dying from opioid overdoses, with little meaningful response by the federal government. At the same time, we are seeing state and local governments taking action, increasingly legalizing marijuana, passing Good Samaritan laws, and even exploring safe consumption sites. Public opinion, too, is increasingly in our favor, with ever larger numbers of people supporting alternatives to current policies of prohibition and criminalization. In this context, DPA˚Ä˚s expertise on drug policy, rigorous analysis, and strong, principled voice stand to make an enormous difference in shaping public opinion and policy, and ultimately making a concrete difference to the lives of millions in the U.S. and beyond.

Over the last 15 years, DPA has expanded from its New York headquarters to a total of eight offices, close to 80 staff, an annual operating budget of approximately $17 million, 25,000 dues-paying members and more than 300,000 online subscribers. It has a solid track record of success at the local, state, and federal levels and consistent visibility in prominent media and policy circles. For more information, please visit our website at www.drugpolicy.org.

The Position

The Researcher and Quantitative Analyst reports to the Director of OAE and assists the Director in developing and implementing strategies on how to better use research and academics, particularly in the areas of criminal justice and quantitative analysis, in its effort to advance drug policy reform. Based in Manhattan, the Policy Manager will work closely with other policy and communications staff to ensure that DPA˚Ä˚s work is informed by the latest research and scholarship and will serve as DPA˚Ä˚s expert on criminal justice data.

Speak publicly to a wide range of audiences, including providing public testimony
Act as a resource to DPA and movement partners on issues related to research, identifying experts, and promoting evidence-based policy, especially in regards criminal justice data
Qualifications

The ideal candidate will be a collegial, self-motivated person who thinks conceptually, creatively, and strategically and who is equally comfortable in a policy and an academic environment.

S/he must be versed in statistical analyses, research design and methods, and be comfortable performing data analysis with criminal justice and other data. S/he will serve as a resource to DPA staff and allies, assist with academic convenings, and work with other researchers and academics to help them engage effectively in policy advocacy. Excellent interpersonal skills, an unwavering commitment to accuracy, and a passion for social and racial justice that includes a fair and equitable drug policy based in research and evidence are essential for success.

Risk & Underwriting Data Scientist,New York Life Insurance Co,"New York Life Insurance Company (˚Ä˚New York Life˚Ä˚ or ˚Ä˚the company˚Ä˚) is the largest mutual life insurance company in the United States*. Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico.
New York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Life˚Ä˚s surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody˚Ä˚s Aaa; Standard & Poor˚Ä˚s AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16).
Financial strength, integrity and humanity˚Ä˚the values upon which New York Life was founded˚Ä˚have guided the company˚Ä˚s decisions and actions for over 170 years.
Lead Data Scientist

New York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Lead Data Scientist in its Center for Data Science and Analytics.

The company has over 150 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back this far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 10,000 agents. We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry. Analytical challenges range from mortality risk (with a number of both medical and non-medical components) to agent recruiting decisions, consumer analytics (segmentation, response, conversion, retention, up-sell), fraud detection and digital advertising placement.

The Center for Data Science and Analytics is the innovative corporate Analytics group within New York Life. We are a rapidly growing entrepreneurial department which aims to design, create and offer innovative data-driven solutions for many parts of the enterprise. We are aided by New York Life˚Ä˚s existing business with a large market share in individual life insurance. We have the freedom to explore external data sources and new statistical techniques, and are excited about delivering a whole new generation of Analytical solutions.

In fact, we are designing and will build one of the first multivariate model-based continuous risk differentiations in the industry. This model will incorporate current underwriting best practices (including medical rules) as features and add other data sources, patterns/ideas and variables to essentially create a rating plan to support the next generation underwriting process at New York Life. This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products will be implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, new product development).

We work with data ranging from demographics, credit and geo data to detailed medical data (medical test results, diagnosis, prescriptions) and social media information. We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you. Life insurance is on the verge of huge change. This is a chance to be part of, actually to drive, the transformation of an industry. Is this not why we became data scientists?

You will apply your highly developed analytical skills to work on all aspects of the life insurance value chain, ranging from risk models, fraud detection, process triaging, and marketing predictions to a variety of other analytics solutions.
You will apply your leadership experience, high energy level and business sense to communicate with internal stakeholders and external vendors while effectively leading complex analytics projects.
You will also ingest and wrangle data, propose analytics strategy, create related business cases, drive several large initiatives, build and implement solutions at scale and give presentations as a subject matter expert.

Position Summary:
We have an exciting opportunity to join our team as a Research Data Associate.

In this role, the successful candidate Research assistant for exploring the mental and cognitive experience of cardiac arrest, including near-death experiences with Dr. Sam Parnia.
The NYU Resuscitation Research Group is a newly established multi-disciplinary group that aims to identify novel methods to save the lives and brains of people who undergo cardiac arrest resuscitation. The complications of cardiac arrest include brain injury, disorders of consciousness and neurocognitive deficits. However, it is increasingly recognized that a systematic approach to cardiac arrest and post-resuscitation care can significantly improve survival, neurological and neurocognitive outcomes. This knowledge, combined with the significant social and medical impact of this condition on human lives, has led to the development of a clinical and research program towards combatting this condition.
Following the advent of modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest (CA), millions of people have survived CA, and many people have provided anecdotal reports of lucid well-structured thought processes with memory formation from a period during CA, including so called near death experiences. In recent years, the accuracy of these reports, have been further supported by evidence from case studies, and more recently large scale prospective CA studies. The occurrence of consciousness at the time CA is highly significant, as data from independent studies indicate that brain function ceases during CA. We are one of the few centers with an established track record of research into real-time non-invasive monitoring of brain resuscitation during CA, as well as the study of consciousness/awareness and the cognitive and mental experience of CA.

This multi-centered, prospective and retrospective study investigates the detailed cognitive recollections of cardiac arrest survivors using a mixed methods approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative research. This study aims to understand conscious awareness and/or mental cognitive states during cardiac arrest/circulatory standstill while examining their relationship with markers of brain resuscitation. Furthermore, we plan to establish themes that relate to the experience of cardiac arrest and their impact on neuropsychological outcomes and quality of life.

Job Responsibilities:
collaborate with the Resuscitation Research team in attending cardiac arrest events where real-time brain monitoring data is collected. After such an event, the student will be responsible for follow up and interviews of cardiac arrest survivors to determine the mental and cognitive experience of cardiac arrest and its impact on neuropsychological outcomes and the quality of life in survivors.
