Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico.\nNew York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Life���s surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody���s Aaa; Standard & Poor���s AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16).\nFinancial strength, integrity and humanity���the values upon which New York Life was founded���have guided the company���s decisions and actions for over 170 years.\nNew York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Lead Data Scientist in its Center for Data Science and Analytics.\n\nThe company has over 150 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back this far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 10,000 agents.

Depending on levels of experience, positions may be at-will Research Scientists; or, term-appointment Flatiron Research Fellows or Associate Research Scientists.\n\n\nThe primary mission of the CCB is to create new computational frameworks that will enable scientists to analyze the large and complex data sets that are being generated by new experimental technologies. Tremendous opportunities for discovery are emerging in the biological and biomedical sciences, as well as in traditional physical and social sciences, but they will require the combined power of theory, data analysis, and simulation. In the biomedical sciences, for example, researchers are being confronted by an explosion of information from genome sequencing, gene expression profiling, proteomics, multi-electrode recording, and multiple high-resolution imaging modalities. The focus remains on problems arising in biophysical modeling, genomics, neuroscience, and structural biology, collaborating closely with experimental colleagues.\n\n\nThe goal of the Neuroscience group is to understand how the brain analyzes large and complex datasets streamed by sensory organs in order to aid efforts at building artificial neural systems and treating mental illness. The group does so by analyzing experimental data, assembling connectomes from high-throughput electron microscopy and determining neuronal dynamics from calcium imaging and multi-electrode recordings.\n\n\nResearchers will develop algorithms for analyzing high-dimensional datasets of brain activity obtained experimentally, for example, via multi-neuronal calcium imaging. Specifically, work on neural dimensionality reduction (i.e., extracting a low-dimensional neural subspace that captures much of the observed variance) will be required. Researchers will explore methods for inferring synaptic connectivity from large-scale calcium imaging and will develop methods that scale favorably with the number of dimensions and avoid the trap of overfitting. Furthermore, researchers will work in collaboration with experimentalists and theorists on the interpretation of these datasets - in particular, the exploration of whether neuronal computation can be modeled by nonnegative matrix factorization.\n\n\nThis position will be based, and have a principle office or workspace, at the foundation.\n\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:\n\n\nEducation:\nPh.D in related field\n\nExperience:\n1-2 years experience in a related field\n\nTHE SIMONS FOUNDATION'S DIVERSITY COMMITMENT\n\nMany of the greatest ideas and discoveries come from a diverse mix of minds, backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating an inclusive work environment.

It���s an ambitious goal���so we���re also building a skilled team of researchers who like big ideas and big challenges. Does that sound like you?\nIf so, read on.\nIn the last decade, the geography of mass incarceration underwent a quiet, dramatic, shift. As incarceration rates in America���s biggest cities leveled out and then declined, rates in small cities and rural America continued to rise. Today, thousands of often overlooked smaller cities, towns, and rural areas have the highest rates of incarceration and, increasingly, the most outsized jails. This untold story calls for ending mass incarceration where it begins���in all of our backyards.\nTo spark reform, Vera���s In Our Backyards project is advancing an ambitious research and communications agenda to inform the public dialogue and guide change to justice policy and practice. Our work is driven by the realization that if we do not respond to the shifting geography of incarceration, the apparent national gains���driven by prison and jail population declines in large metropolitan areas���will be eroded by deepening problems in the small and rural communities across the country that actually comprise most of the population.\nResponsibilities\nThe data engineer will work in close collaboration with the team to collect, manage, and analyze data relevant to the criminal justice system, to visualize the results of these analyses, and to report findings to our partners and the public.

    "description": "The Bureau of Primary Care Access & Planning (PCAP), within the Division of Prevention and Primary Care, at the NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is seeking a City Research Scientist III to serve as a Senior Data Scientist. During this period of unprecedented health care reform, primary care remains a key anchor to advance population health and is undergoing rapid change. PCAP has a dedicated staff working to improve access to quality, culturally appropriate primary care for New Yorkers, particularly those who are at risk for poor health outcomes. The Bureau sets and implements policy, program and research initiatives aimed at maximizing the impact of primary care on population health, including increasing health insurance coverage and reducing access barriers for vulnerable populations served by the NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene. PCAP contains two offices: Office Health Insurance Services (OHIS) and Office of Health Planning (HP). These units work in collaboration to ensure on-the ground programmatic work and policy and data activities are continuously informing one another. Since 2000, OHIS has worked to educate the NYC uninsured population about their health insurance options and enroll individuals into coverage. Enrollers specialize in helping low-income, medically vulnerable, minority and immigrant communities. Even before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, various public and private agencies in New York State, including DOHMH, worked to address the persistent problem of uninsured residents who are eligible for public insurance yet not enrolled. After the ACA-created New York State of Health Marketplace launched, OHIS staff were trained and designated as Certified Application Counselors (CACs) to provide assistance with enrolling individuals into public insurance programs and new Qualified Health Plans (QHPs).

Staff have also developed expertise in and conduct research on the intersection of emergency preparedness and primary care with a focus on reducing primary care access deficits post-disaster. As part of the policy focused work, HP has been analyzing, monitoring, and weighing in on the implementation of the insurance expansion components of the Affordable Care Act and NY's state-based Marketplace from the perspective of low-income and vulnerable populations.

    "company": "UNICEF",
    "description": "UNICEF works in some of the world���s toughest places, to reach the world���s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.\n\nAcross 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.\n\nAnd we never give up.\n\nBackground & Rationale\n\nThe United Nation���s 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals present a unique opportunity to advance the children���s agenda with a strong emphasize on the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families and in line with UNICEF���s mission. As a defining trend of our times, while urbanization is a driver of development, it is not without its challenges, particularly for slum dwellers. Already, one city dweller in three lives in slum conditions, lacking security of tenure in overcrowded, unhygienic places characterized by unemployment, climate-induced disasters, pollution, violence, poor services and competition over resources. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions, and children and young people are the most susceptible to the negative aspects of living in slums. As the urban population burgeons, it is clear that increasingly urban poor and marginalized children are becoming among the most disadvantaged.\n\nUNICEF has recognized urbanization as an area of evolving importance that poses among the greatest risks and opportunities for children and young people to realize their rights and have a fair chance at life. To help expand these opportunities while also responding to the increasing risks in urban settings, UNICEF has been working to develop policies and guidelines that focus on building sustainable cities for and with children and young people, and in close partnership with government. These tools have started to lay down the ground work for a global urban strategy that will guide and scale up the organization���s work in urban areas at the global, national and local levels.\n\nOne of the five pillars of that strategy is ���Adapting urban planning and budgeting for children living in urban settings���, describing UNICEF���s role to advocate for a child perspective in urban spatial planning and development for urban planners, infrastructure developers, and the private sector to make children���s rights and needs a central tenet of their work. The Division of Data, Research and Policy has developed the Handbook on Child Responsive Urban Planning that describes Children���s Rights and Urban Planning Principles and urban planning instruments to ensure child-responsive urban settings. The handbook will support countries to push this agenda through global and regional partnerships, in order to act as a technical advisor or key advocate to implementing partners to promote child-responsive urban spatial planning and infrastructure development.\n\nUNICEF will also use the handbook internally as it lays out relevant elements related with land use, infrastructural norms and standards, participatory urban planning and geo-spatial data, which will support the development of more detailed and improved instruments to support UNICEF���s work for children in urban settings:\n\nProvision of possible indicators to measure progress of the child-responsiveness of urban settings on a local or national level, relevant for the Strategic Plan output indicator 4.d.2, (Number of countries where urban/local government development plans and budgets and urban planning standards are child-responsive and involve participation of children.) and for a new set of indicators for the Child Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI) cycle for developing countries (SitAns, M&E, ��f);\nProvision of geo-spatial data management practice to support measurement of intra-urban disparities, relevant for the Strategic Plan output indicator 4.d.1 (Number of countries with data on intra-urban disparities, including girls and boys in informal settings) and to localize most disadvantaged urban populations (expansion of relevant urban data sets MICS, administrative, geo-spatial and big data);\nDefinition of spatial and land use characteristics of urban settings, relevant to support an urban landscape analysis, urban poverty analysis in urban settings and the definition of needed ���quality social services in urban settings���;\nDefinition of spatial planning related policies to support UNICEF���s urban programs on a national level and local level (building regulations, urban planning and transportation policy, land use, neighborhood planning, school environments, child-friendly public space networks, public financing of the built environment, geo-spatial data);\nProvision of tools to integrate children���s participation in urban planning, in particular adolescents and young people, relevant for the Strategic Plan output indicator 4.d.2 and the CFCI action plans;\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of the contract is to provide support to the Urban Planning component within the Urban portfolio of the Policy Analysis Unit. Under the guidance of the Senior Urban Advisor in the Policy Analysis Unit at the Division of Data, Research and Policy in UNICEF, the consultant will support the roll-out the Handbook on Child-responsive Urban Planning outside UNICEF and within the organization, along three pillars: 1. outreach, 2. capacity development and 3. technical assistance. This roll-out has been described in detail in a roll out strategy.\n\nExpected results: (measurable results)\n\nProduction of the following documents:\n\nOutreach package containing an on-line softcopy of the handbook, internal and external mailing, presentation material for various audiences, dissemination within UNICEF (global broadcast Message, Yammer, brown bags);\nCapacity Development Program with a Training of Trainers module and an Urban Planning Module for Practitioners, including workshops for local government authorities and webinars for UNICEF staff on child-responsive urban planning;\nTechnical Assistance to selected Regional Offices, Country Offices and National Committees in the roll-out of the Handbook on Child-Responsive Urban Planning and in urban development issues.

We envision a just society in which the use and regulation of drugs are grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights; in which people are no longer punished for what they put into their own bodies but only for crimes against others; and in which the fears, prejudices, and punitive prohibitions of today are no more. Our mission is to advance those policies and attitudes that best reduce the harms of both drug misuse and drug prohibition, and to promote the sovereignty of individuals over their minds and bodies.\n\nThe Researcher and Quantitative Analyst will join our passionate, diverse, and creative team at a critical time for the drug policy reform movement in the United States. U.S. leaders are now doubling down on the war on drugs, using it as a tool to stoke fear in society and rally their base, and as an excuse to lock up or deport people of color and immigrants. Tens of thousands of people are dying from opioid overdoses, with little meaningful response by the federal government. At the same time, we are seeing state and local governments taking action, increasingly legalizing marijuana, passing Good Samaritan laws, and even exploring safe consumption sites. Public opinion, too, is increasingly in our favor, with ever larger numbers of people supporting alternatives to current policies of prohibition and criminalization. In this context, DPA���s expertise on drug policy, rigorous analysis, and strong, principled voice stand to make an enormous difference in shaping public opinion and policy, and ultimately making a concrete difference to the lives of millions in the U.S. and beyond.\n\nOver the last 15 years, DPA has expanded from its New York headquarters to a total of eight offices, close to 80 staff, an annual operating budget of approximately $17 million, 25,000 dues-paying members and more than 300,000 online subscribers. It has a solid track record of success at the local, state, and federal levels and consistent visibility in prominent media and policy circles. For more information, please visit our website at www.drugpolicy.org.\n\nThe Position\n\nThe Researcher and Quantitative Analyst reports to the Director of OAE and assists the Director in developing and implementing strategies on how to better use research and academics, particularly in the areas of criminal justice and quantitative analysis, in its effort to advance drug policy reform. Based in Manhattan, the Policy Manager will work closely with other policy and communications staff to ensure that DPA���s work is informed by the latest research and scholarship and will serve as DPA���s expert on criminal justice data.\nPrimary Responsibilities\nThe Researcher and Quantitative Analyst is responsible for the following:\n\nConduct literature reviews to help staff and others understand a range of drug policy issues\nAnalyze and respond to new studies with critiques and analysis for staff, the public, and the media\nRequest (with legal advice) and analyze primary data from federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies as well as other data sets\nDraft materials, including data analyses, literature reviews, blog posts and op eds\nAssist with developing programming and preparing speakers and materials for meetings and conferences\nAssist with training academics to engage effectively with policymakers and the media\nAdvise elected and appointed officials on evidence-based drug policies\nCultivate relationships with researchers from a wide range of disciplines and identify and mobilize academics in service of DPA policy campaigns\nSpeak publicly to a wide range of audiences, including providing public testimony\nAct as a resource to DPA and movement partners on issues related to research, identifying experts, and promoting evidence-based policy, especially in regards criminal justice data\nQualifications\n\nThe ideal candidate will be a collegial, self-motivated person who thinks conceptually, creatively, and strategically and who is equally comfortable in a policy and an academic environment. S/he will have a terminal degree (PhD, MD, JD, etc.) or a masters with substantive experience working with criminal justice data. S/he must be able to synthetize research from a broad range of disciplines and have the written and verbal communication skills to translate academic information for lay or policy audiences and to form deep connections within academia. S/he must be versed in statistical analyses, research design and methods, and be comfortable performing data analysis with criminal justice and other data. S/he will serve as a resource to DPA staff and allies, assist with academic convenings, and work with other researchers and academics to help them engage effectively in policy advocacy. Excellent interpersonal skills, an unwavering commitment to accuracy, and a passion for social and racial justice that includes a fair and equitable drug policy based in research and evidence are essential for success. This position is grant-funded. Although we will pursue additional funding to extend the position, currently funding has only been secured for one year.\n\nAdditional qualifications:\n\nUnderstanding of research design and ability to quickly review and critique the meaning, methodology, and quality of studies\nInterest in and deep knowledge of criminal justice and drug use data\nComfort talking to policymakers, researchers, and the media\nExperience with and/or knowledge of academia\nAbility to plan and implement meetings and conferences\nExpertise and knowledge of criminal justice data, criminology, and a background in applied statistics\nDemonstrated ability to analyze, understand, and communicate complex science and research from a range of disciplines to a general audience and an audience of policymakers\nSharp academic skills and credibility with academia as demonstrated through original research and/or scholarly publications\nTerminal degree in public policy/administration, public health, law, sociology, criminal justice, history, medicine, or related field required.

    "description": "New York Life Insurance Company (���New York Life��� or ���the company���) is the largest mutual life insurance company in the United States*. Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico.\nNew York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Life���s surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody���s Aaa; Standard & Poor���s AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16).\nFinancial strength, integrity and humanity���the values upon which New York Life was founded���have guided the company���s decisions and actions for over 170 years.\nLead Data Scientist\n\nNew York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Lead Data Scientist in its Center for Data Science and Analytics.\n\nThe company has over 150 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back this far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 10,000 agents. We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry. Analytical challenges range from mortality risk (with a number of both medical and non-medical components) to agent recruiting decisions, consumer analytics (segmentation, response, conversion, retention, up-sell), fraud detection and digital advertising placement.\n\nThe Center for Data Science and Analytics is the innovative corporate Analytics group within New York Life. We are a rapidly growing entrepreneurial department which aims to design, create and offer innovative data-driven solutions for many parts of the enterprise. We are aided by New York Life���s existing business with a large market share in individual life insurance. We have the freedom to explore external data sources and new statistical techniques, and are excited about delivering a whole new generation of Analytical solutions.\n\nIn fact, we are designing and will build one of the first multivariate model-based continuous risk differentiations in the industry. This model will incorporate current underwriting best practices (including medical rules) as features and add other data sources, patterns/ideas and variables to essentially create a rating plan to support the next generation underwriting process at New York Life. This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products will be implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, new product development).\n\nWe work with data ranging from demographics, credit and geo data to detailed medical data (medical test results, diagnosis, prescriptions) and social media information. We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you. Life insurance is on the verge of huge change. This is a chance to be part of, actually to drive, the transformation of an industry. Is this not why we became data scientists?\n\nYou will apply your highly developed analytical skills to work on all aspects of the life insurance value chain, ranging from risk models, fraud detection, process triaging, and marketing predictions to a variety of other analytics solutions.\nYou will apply your leadership experience, high energy level and business sense to communicate with internal stakeholders and external vendors while effectively leading complex analytics projects.\nYou will also ingest and wrangle data, propose analytics strategy, create related business cases, drive several large initiatives, build and implement solutions at scale and give presentations as a subject matter expert.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nIndependently leads data analysis and modeling projects from project/sample design, business review meetings with internal and external clients deriving requirements/deliverables, reception and processing of data, performing analyses and modeling to final reports/presentations, communication of results and implementation support.\nDemonstrates to internal and external stakeholders how analytics can be implemented to maximize business benefits.

Resolves problems and removes obstacles to timely and high-quality project completion.\nCreate project milestone plans to ensure projects are completed on time and within budget. Provides high quality ongoing customer support; answering questions, resolving problems and building solutions.\nActively contributes to analytics strategy by contributing ideas, preparing presentation material for internal stakeholders, and product design/business case materials for NYL leadership.\nFollows industry trends in insurance and related data/analytics processes and businesses. Functions as the analytics expert in meetings with other internal areas and external vendors. Actively participates in proof of concept tests of new data, software and technologies.\nAssures compliance with regulatory and privacy requirements during design and implementation of modeling and analysis projects.\nTravels to events and vendor meetings as needed (< 10%).\n\nRequired qualifications\n\nGraduate-level degree with concentration in a quantitative discipline such as statistics, computer science, mathematics, economics, or operations research OR Associateship/Fellowship in one of the Actuarial Societies.\n5+ years of experience with statistical modeling using large and complex datasets in a business setting.\n3+ years of experience in the insurance industry (life, health or P&C).\nStrong verbal and written communications skills, listening and teamwork skills, and effective presentation skills.

For 175 years, NYU School of Medicine has trained thousands of physicians and scientists who have helped to shape the course of medical history and enrich the lives of countless people. An integral part of NYU Langone Health , the School of Medicine at its core is committed to improving the human condition through medical education, scientific research, and direct patient care. For more information, go to med.nyu.edu , and interact with us on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\nPosition Summary:\nWe have an exciting opportunity to join our team as a Research Data Associate.\n\nIn this role, the successful candidate Research assistant for exploring the mental and cognitive experience of cardiac arrest, including near-death experiences with Dr. Sam Parnia.\nThe NYU Resuscitation Research Group is a newly established multi-disciplinary group that aims to identify novel methods to save the lives and brains of people who undergo cardiac arrest resuscitation. The complications of cardiac arrest include brain injury, disorders of consciousness and neurocognitive deficits. However, it is increasingly recognized that a systematic approach to cardiac arrest and post-resuscitation care can significantly improve survival, neurological and neurocognitive outcomes. This knowledge, combined with the significant social and medical impact of this condition on human lives, has led to the development of a clinical and research program towards combatting this condition.\nFollowing the advent of modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest (CA), millions of people have survived CA, and many people have provided anecdotal reports of lucid well-structured thought processes with memory formation from a period during CA, including so called near death experiences. In recent years, the accuracy of these reports, have been further supported by evidence from case studies, and more recently large scale prospective CA studies. The occurrence of consciousness at the time CA is highly significant, as data from independent studies indicate that brain function ceases during CA. We are one of the few centers with an established track record of research into real-time non-invasive monitoring of brain resuscitation during CA, as well as the study of consciousness/awareness and the cognitive and mental experience of CA.\n\nThis multi-centered, prospective and retrospective study investigates the detailed cognitive recollections of cardiac arrest survivors using a mixed methods approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative research. This study aims to understand conscious awareness and/or mental cognitive states during cardiac arrest/circulatory standstill while examining their relationship with markers of brain resuscitation. Furthermore, we plan to establish themes that relate to the experience of cardiac arrest and their impact on neuropsychological outcomes and quality of life.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\ncollaborate with the Resuscitation Research team in attending cardiac arrest events where real-time brain monitoring data is collected. After such an event, the student will be responsible for follow up and interviews of cardiac arrest survivors to determine the mental and cognitive experience of cardiac arrest and its impact on neuropsychological outcomes and the quality of life in survivors. The student will be involved with patient recruitment, interviews, and data analysis\nProvide material for and/or initiate IRB correspondence.\nAware of study regulatory status and keep an up to date copy of regulatory documents.\nRecord, update, edit and maintain confidential information onto paperwork or web-based forms in a neat, accurate and timely manner and ensure subsequent data collection as required.\nRespond to requests in a timely manner, give/receive correct information, encourage required dialogue/follow-through.\nMaintain files in an organized and up-to-date manner in order to facilitate their retrieval and maintains copies of all required on-going documentation and forms for the files.\nCompletes filing in accordance with department procedures.\nDuplicates and collates materials upon request.\nThorough knowledge of research study, study rationale, study subject, and clinical procedures associated with the study.\nRecruitment capabilities and the screening of potential patients/subjects for eligibility to the study.\nReview all the elements of the screening process with the Principal Investigator.\nCollaborate with various personnel that may be involved in assisting with specific aspects in the study.\nDemonstrate knowledge of policies and procedures of the host institution where the study is being conducted and the regulatory requirements such as IRB and other approvals if necessary.\nUtilize available resources and established procedures to identify problems for quick resolution.\nConduct study visits, obtain and document information within the time frame specified.\nMonitor any outward effects or issues regarding patient/subject safety and report this to the Principal Investigator, Physician and Research Nurse.\nWorks with the principal investigators and research nurses on monitoring the overall conduct of the study.\nTracks study milestones and patient accruals to help evaluate the progress of studies.\nReviews data with supervisor and provides reports to the data and safety monitoring committee.\nWorks with departments, labs, other personnel and areas as needed, to ensure the timely transfer of items and biological materials: study drugs;
