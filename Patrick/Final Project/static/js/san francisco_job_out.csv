Data Scientist,Bold Metrics,"WHO WE ARE
Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.
We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the world˚Ä˚s largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

Want to bring a $15B sector of the insurance industry into the 21st century? Yearning for a startup built around machine learning? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs title insurance. The current incumbents pay only 5% of their intake as claims; they spend about 85% running a manual process that involves frequent paper searches and phone calls for millions of mortgages every year.

States Title is modernizing this antiquated process and will scale rapidly to grab a large fraction of the market. By bringing data science to title insurance, we can repurpose those wasted billions towards making homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way.

"Lead Product Manager, Data (multiple positions)",Credit Karma,"The product management team at Credit Karma is the driving force to expanding our service beyond credit and enabling our members to make progress across their entire financial life. Credit Karma is quickly becoming the ˚Ä˚money button on the phone˚Ä˚ for our 80M+ members, enabling enormous opportunities to innovate at scale. Many of our team previously worked at startups or scaled environments, but joined to innovate at scale. Credit Karma provides the rare chance to work in a small team and environment while having massive impact to our members.

Our team has doubled in size in the past 18 months and continues to grow rapidly. As with most product management positions, we expect you to have strong analytical or engineering skills, communicate exceptionally well, find joy in organizing complexity and obsoleting chaos, and have a teaching and learning mindset.
However, unlike product management at other companies, our team is different in a few key ways:
To get the next level for the company and for our product, we need to deliver on powerful innovations. We fully expect the product to look dramatically different in the coming years than it does today, expanding from a good product into a bigger and better one. Entrepreneurs are welcome, and many of our product team were former founders and CEOs. Additionally, we also require the ability to succeed at scale. We are building many projects in parallel, and you will have constraints and challenges that exist in a larger, more complicated company.
Many of our successful PMs do not have engineering or software degrees. We find that grit matched with analytical, business and domain experience are just as critical, and we evaluate each skill and match it with an appropriate role.
We recruit generalists since they thrive in a growth environment. Most of our PMs work on more than one initiative in their first year, and almost certainly within their second. Prepare to be challenged and work on projects that range from immature pre-product fit to larger, market leading initiatives.
Product management is a discipline of mastering responsibility often without authority. This skill matters even more in a large growth company and we˚Ä˚ve found this is often connected with a person˚Ä˚s soft skills or emotional intelligence (EQ). We screen for high EQ and coach how to improve this, as it˚Ä˚s quite connected to our culture and what sets our team apart from the industry.
One of our fundamental beliefs is that diversity delivers a better set of products and outcomes for our consumers and business. As such, we seek to create safe environments so that each employee can be their best self and do their best work. The product management team is the foundation for this value and it leads to the broadest, most diverse and joyful exchange of ideas and innovations. PMs who are used to being the loudest voice in the room winning or creating conflicts to find a path forward struggle to succeed in our team.
Team Structure
We divide our team into three levels: individual contributors (ICs), leads, and executives. Our ICs titles are Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, and Senior Product Manager. These ICs are experts at shipping software with increasing scope and complexity. Even at these levels, given the hypergrowth we are experiencing, these PMs own the crafting and execution of features or sections of the product. Their core skills include excellence in partnership, communication, distilling requirements, and prioritization with cross-functional teams.
Our lead titles are Staff Product Manager, Associate Director, and Director. Leads are responsible for one or more product areas in the product, often managing small teams or creating new products and roadmaps from the beginning. This requires mastery of working in a scaled environment and solving consumer and financial partner opportunities and constraints. Successful leads have worked at scale previously, delivered on successful products in their past, have excellent core product management skills, and can innovate.
Management experience is desirable but not required. We do expect this level to mentor other PMs and teams across the whole company. Our leads typically do not manage large hierarchical teams, instead favoring small, swift moving cross-functional pods that are as self-contained as possible. If you like innovating at scale in a hands-on builder environment, a senior product management position might be for you.
Lastly, our executive titles are Senior Director and Vice President. PM executives own a business area or a complete product line, often managing a set of leads. This level not only has the responsibility to build out their product area but also partner with other senior leaders across the company to shape the culture and future direction of our company.

BetterUp will be targeting more senior level HR executives, CHROs, CXOs inside of organizations who think and worry about employee retention and performance, and talent-obsessed CEOs.

College Financial Coach,Moneythink,"The American higher education system is broken: only 12% of low-income youth successfully obtain a bachelor˚Ä˚s degree in their lifetime and 70% of those who drop out cite financial stress as the major cause. Moneythink coaches provide an innovative response, enabling students to be successful despite financial challenges.

Coaches provide one-on-one, text-message-based guidance to students. You˚Ä˚ll work with our knowledge and tools to develop relationships that lead to measurable impacts for hundreds of students. You˚Ä˚ll help students make progress toward college success every day.
As a coach at Moneythink, you˚Ä˚ll be in a one-of-a-kind position - you will be part motivator, part tech support, part financial aid expert, part financial advisor, and part behavioral scientist. Here is what a typical day might look like: First thing in the morning you check the inbox for any urgent messages from students and then review your data dashboard in order to start planning who to reach out to that day. At 10am you meet with the coaching team to talk about your daily goals. You then spend the next couple hours crafting conversations with students and updating your student records. At one point, you wait on hold for 15 minutes when you call a school˚Ä˚s Financial Aid Office to find out about a student deadline - but you eventually get an answer and can help your student. At the end of the day, you spend some time writing a guide that helps students cut their textbook costs.
As a part of a growing nonprofit tech startup, you˚Ä˚ll partner with our product development team to constantly develop better student-facing software and coach-supporting tools that make us more effective and empower us to scale. You˚Ä˚ll help accelerate the national movement for college affordability and equal access to opportunity.
Responsibilities
You will guide high school seniors to complete goals for financial aid, college match, college budgeting, and transitioning to college.
Craft highly effective messages to students by incorporating information about a student, with an understanding of their context, efficient conversation design, and clear writing.
Manage a caseload of 250 - 300 students. Practice effective triaging through diligent maintenance of student records and using up-to-date data to prioritize outreach.
